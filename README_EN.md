## üìñ Project Introduction
‚Äã	This project, named "The God of Cookery," is inspired by the renowned movie of the same name starring the comedic master, Stephen Chow. The project's goal is to provide cooking advice and recipe recommendations through artificial intelligence technology, helping users to enhance their cooking skills and reduce the barriers to cooking, thereby realizing the movie's message: "With heart, anyone can become a god of cookery."
‚Äã	The core concept of this application is based on the InternLM dialogue model, which has been fine-tuned using the XiaChuFang Recipe Corpus, consisting of 1,520,327 Chinese recipes. The model is hosted on [ModelScope](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/zhanghuiATchina/zhangxiaobai_shishen2_full/summary), and the application is deployed on [OpenXLab](https://openxlab.org.cn/apps/detail/zhanghui-china/shishen2024). Special thanks to the Moda Community for providing free space for model hosting and to OpenXLab for offering the deployment environment and GPU resources.
‚Äã	Please note that the answers provided by this application are intended for reference only and should not be considered as actual steps for recipe preparation. Due to the "hallucination" characteristics of large-scale models, some recipes might cause psychological or physiological effects. Users are advised not to take these recipes out of context.

## üó∫Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### 1. Overall Technical Architecture

The project primarily relies on the open-source model from the Shanghai AI Lab, known as internlm-chat-7b, which includes both first and second generations. We fine-tuned this model on the XiaChuFang Recipe Corpus, which consists of 1,520,327 Chinese recipes. This tuning was facilitated by Xtuner with LoRA fine-tuning, resulting in the creation of the shishen2_full model. Post-tuning, the model was integrated with a vector database into Langchain, achieving an enhanced retrieval effect through RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). It supports multimodal (voice, text, image) question-answering dialogues. The frontend interaction with users is implemented using Streamlit.

### 2. Application Workflow

Upon receiving a request from a user, the application loads the models (voice model, text-to-image model, fine-tuned dialogue model) and processes the user's text or voice input. If the RAG switch is not activated, it directly calls the fine-tuned dialogue model to generate a reply, formats the result, and uses the stable diffusion model to generate an image, finally returning the result to the user. If the RAG switch is activated, it uses Langchain to search the vector database, inputs the search results into the fine-tuned dialogue model to generate a reply, formats the result, and calls the stable diffusion model to generate an image, ultimately returning the result to the user.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Guide

### 1. Data Set Preparation

Download the 1.5 million XiaChuFang fine-tuning dataset: [Download Link (password: 8489)](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1TyqDWRI5jOs621VXr-uMoQ)

### 2. Installation

- Set up a Python virtual environment:

```bash
conda create -n cook python=3.10 -y
conda activate cook
```

- Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/SmartFlowAI/TheGodOfCookery.git
cd ./TheGodOfCookery
```

- Install PyTorch and other dependencies:

```
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: Choose the CUDA version according to your own CUDA installation, typically 11.8 or 12.1.

### 3. Training

- Train the first-generation 7b model using xtuner 0.1.9, fine-tune on internlm-chat-7b.
- Train the second-generation 7b model using xtuner 0.1.13, fine-tune on internlm2-chat-7b.
- Train the second-generation 1.8b model using xtuner 0.1.15.dev0, fine-tune on internlm2-chat-1.8b.

Fine-tuning method:

```
xtuner train ${YOUR_CONFIG} --deepspeed deepspeed_zero2
```

`--deepspeed` indicates using [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed) to optimize the training process. XTuner integrates several strategies, including ZeRO-1, ZeRO-2, and ZeRO-3. If you wish to disable this feature, simply remove this parameter.

Convert the saved `.pth` model (if using DeepSpeed, this will be a directory) into a LoRA model:

```
export MKL_SERVICE_FORCE_INTEL=1
xtuner convert pth_to_hf ${YOUR_CONFIG} ${PTH} ${LoRA_PATH}
```

Merge the LoRA model into the HuggingFace model:

```
xtuner convert merge ${Base_PATH} ${LoRA_PATH} ${SAVE_PATH}
```

### 4. Dialogue

```
xtuner chat ${SAVE_PATH} [optional arguments]
```

Arguments:

- `--prompt-template`: Use 'internlm_chat' for the first-generation model and 'internlm2_chat' for the second-generation model.
- `--system`: Specify the dialogue system identifier.
- `--bits {4,8,None}`: Specify the LLM's bit rate. Default is fp16.
- `--no-streamer`: If you want to remove the streamer.
- `--top`: For second-generation models, a recommendation of 0.8.
- `--temperature`: For second-generation models, a recommendation of 0.8.
- `--repetition-penalty`: For the second-generation 7b model, recommended 1.002; for the 1.8b model, recommended 1.17; for the first-generation model, no need to specify.
- For more information, execute `xtuner chat -h` to view.
